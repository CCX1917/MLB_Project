    "In sports leagues across the United States, team analytics departments have revolutionized the way that professional sports are played. In the past decade in the NBA (National Basketball Association) especially, teams are shooting more and more three-point shots, as even making them 33% of the time is as valuable as making two-point shots 50% of the time. The first league to adopt the work of analytics departments, though, was probably the MLB (Major League Baseball), as told in the book _Moneyball_ by Michael Lewis, in 2003, about the Oakland Athletics. Since then, so many more statistics have been developed and analyzed in order to predict and model success, such as the exit velocity of baseballs off of bats, pitching arsenals of pitchers, and WAR (wins above replacement).

    "Another feature of the three major sports leagues in the United States (NFL, NBA, MLB) are the different rules pertaining to how much teams can spend on players each year (salary cap). The NFL has a hard salary cap set each year because of team revenue sharing, meaning that no team can have their players' \"cap hits\" be above the hard cap any given year. The NBA has a hybrid salary cap model, having both a luxury tax and a hard cap. Teams generally stay below the soft cap, but if they desire, they can spend above it, having to pay a \"luxury tax\" in addition to what they are already paying their players. However, there still is a hard salary cap limit that the teams cannot go above. Finally, the MLB has almost no salary cap rules (as there is no revenue sharing between teams), having only a \"competitive balance\" tax similar to the NBA's luxury tax, but even fewer teams go above it and there is no hard salary cap maximum. As long as a team is willing to pay in Major League Baseball, there is theoretically no spending limit per year."

    "Using more standard and conventional statistics across a season (like runs scored, home-runs, etc), how well can the number of wins or even winning the division for a team be modeled and predicted? Do teams with higher payroll win more often? How effective is the competitive balance tax in the MLB? How well does regular season success predict post-season success? Using the model for wins, how impactful are/were individual players (both batters and pitchers)? Who are/were some of the most impactful individual players in the MLB? How valuable are/were individual players for their team? Who are/were some of the most valuable individual players? Were impactful and valuable individual players properly recognized by conventional awards (All-Star, Silver Slugger Award, MVP, etc)?"

    "- Regular season statistics are very good at predicting the number of wins a team had and pretty good at identifying division winners, but not for predicting post-season success.\n",
    "- The competitive balance tax appears to be fairly effective at maintaining parity across the MLB.\n",
    "- Individual players can be very impactful to a team, although the majority are not.\n",
    "- The most valuable players historically were those on their rookie contracts.\n",
    "- Historically great, impactful players were typically properly recognized by conventional awards, but valuable ones were not very frequently.\n",
    "- Since valuable players are often on rookie contracts, those that were very valuable often went on to become great players."

    "For the database generally, the data appears to be the commonly discussed and used statistics in baseball (wins, losses, ERA, runs, etc). Because this is a historical archive, some of the newer \"advanced\" statistics were not recorded because they didn't exist during earlier baseball seasons. On the other hand, knowing the salaries of specific players (to get the total payroll of a team) relies on agents or teams releasing contract details, which at least for this dataset, appeared to be an issue before 1985 because no data is recorded before then. However, because this information would have to be released by only a few people, contract information presumably would be released with the consent of players and agents (as often in sports, agents release contract details of their clients to attract new ones, especially new players coming out of college).

    "The main datasets (the Team, Batting, and Pitching) were orderly preprocessed, each row being organized by year, and by team in alphabetical order (for Team set). In order to add the salary information, I pulled from the Salary file in the original dataset (not included in final sets). For the Salary file, the data was organized the same, but had the salaries of individual players for each season and team. To get the data in the form that I am using, I found the total payroll for each team's season by adding up all the player salaries for those categories, and then added a column into the team statistics dataset. For individual players (batters and pitchers), I just pulled the salary for that specific player and put it into its own column. To get more relevant statistics, I only took columns most useful for analyzing winning (wins, losses, playoff victories, runs, etc) and identification (full name of player). Finally, in the team statistics dataset, I added a column containing the Z-Score of each team's total salary for that season, by finding the mean and standard deviation of the teams' total payroll for each payroll and calculating from there (see Appendix)."

    "As seen in the histograms and score, the baseline model is already fairly good. Runs scored and runs given up explains 77% of the variability in the amount of wins. Furthermore, the model successfully predicted the exact number of wins a team won in a season over 120 times, over 1/9 of all instances in the dataset. Additionally, a lot of the predictions were within 5 games (above or below), which is very good, considering an MLB season is 162 games long. However, there were some bad misses, ranging from underpredicting 14 wins all the way to overpredicting by 24 wins."

    "The inputs for this model are: runs scored, earned run average, and fielding percentage. This seems to be an effective, low dimensional model, as each input variable reflects a different aspect of the game of baseball (runs scored for batting, ERA for pitching, and fielding percentage for defense/fielding). Interestingly, the best predictor of wins (besides runs scored) was the team's earned run average, which was even better than runs given up or earned runs given up. Additionally, including fielding percentage as a third input added about .013 to the score, meaning that these inputs explained about 88.2% of the variability in the amount of wins a team had across a season, an improvement of about 11% over the baseline model."

    "The model is fairly good at predicting divisional wins or losses for teams based on the same input variables from the wins model. It correctly identified 96% of teams that did not win their division, although it was not great at identifying/predicting division winners, correctly doing so only about 45% of the time. Based on how logistic regressions work, a team that won their division may not have been correctly identified, because their score was less than, but close to .5, which would mean they would have the greatest chance of winning their division (out of the five teams in it), but not greater than the 50% required to identify it as a winner; vice versa, a team may have had a greater than 50% chance of winning the division, but ended up losing because there was another strong team in the division that ended up winning it (even outcomes with a chance above 50% can not happen sometimes)."

    "Strangely enough, limiting the sample to just division winners makes the model even worse. Although it makes sense the precision for non-league winners to be worse (smaller sample), the model does not even predict a single team to win the league. This can be explained for two reasons: 1. Since the teams are all division winners, they all were very successful during the regular season, which means the differences between them in runs scored, ERA, and fielding percentage are probably not very great, so it can be very hard to distinguish between them; 2. Since playoff series are 5 games for the divisional round and 7 for the league championship, they are such small samples that a team may not produce as well as they did during the regular season in that small sample (regular season success is not the most predictive of post-season success)."

    "This model does a decent job at identifying teams that won the World Series, even though it has a lower score (58% of the variability compared to almost 97%). Teams that were better in the regular season and won their league won the World Series about 58% of the time. Once again, due to the small sample size (only 7 games in the World Series), a team that was better across the 162 game season may not perform as well as the other team in a 7 game sample. Additionally, since teams that play each other in the World Series probably only had marginal differences in success during the regular season (made the playoffs and were good enough during them to win the playoff series), so this modeling and predicting seems to do about as well as one could expect."

Other notable names in the top-25 are 14x All-Star Alex Rodriguez (2nd overall in win-shares with his 2007 season, where he won AL MVP), 5x All-Star Todd Helton, 7x All-Star Sammy Sosa, and Hall of Famers Jeff Bagwell, Roberto Alomar, and Larry Walker. Andres Galarraga was the only one who was not an All-Star for his season on this list (his 1996 season), although he did earn a Silver Slugger Award for it (which is awarded to the best batters for the season, by position). Many others also won the Silver Slugger Award for their seasons on this list, all suggesting that conventional awards were given to at least historically great seasons (the best batting seasons between 1985 and 2016) and thus properly recognized."

    "In looking at the entire distribution of total win shares, about 25000 batters' seasons had total win shares between 0 and 1, with a very extreme dropoff after that. There are so few batters with seasons of total win shares greater than 20 or 21 that the count doesn't even appear in the histogram count as a visible bar. Based on this distribution, the majority of players' seasons (about 25000) out of the 40577 instances had very little impact to their team's success (with win shares being between 0 and 1), but a decent amount contributed to over 10 (quite impactful in a 162 game season, especially with a 26 player roster for MLB teams)."

    "Ignoring the first overall valuable batter's season (Dion James, whose 0 dollar salary seems impossible and is almost certainly a mistake in the original database), the most valuable season by a player was Albert Pujols' rookie season (2001) with the St. Louis Cardinals, who contributed over 20 win shares while only costing about .25% of the team's overall payroll. For this season, he was an All-Star and won the Silver Slugger Award, and is currently a 10x All-Star, 3x NL MVP, and 6x Silver Slugger Award winner. Since MVP (Most Valuable Player) is often given to the best player for the season (not the most _valuable_, in terms of actual value by salary), none of these players won the MVP for the season they were on the list for. However, many were still recognized as All-Stars or awarded the Silver Slugger for it. Looking at the overall makeup of this list, all of these players were still on their rookie contracts, which means their fraction of the team's payroll is very small. Therefore, having strong seasons while on their rookie contracts means they are very valuable to their teams. The list is also seems to be indicative of future success, as players on it would become very good or even great players in later seasons, such as Hall of Famer Derek Jeter and current 4x All-Star and 2018 AL MVP Mookie Betts. If the MVP award was given for actual _value_ to their team using their salaries, instead of just being the best player that season no matter their contract, this list would be a great reference for it. For how awards are given in the MLB currently, though, this list shows historically great batters on their rookie contracts (or even simply rookies, as Pujols and Jeter's seasons are from their rookie seasons, where they each won Rookie of the Year)."

    "Moving onto pitchers, since a greater ERA is worse for a team (and contributes to losses), better pitchers are ones who have a lower ERA. Instead of win shares then, I will use \"Loss Shares,\" by taking the negative of the coefficient for ERA in the model. Also, since the model uses the team's overall ERA, to measure the individual impact of a pitcher for the season, I am going to take the fraction of games played by the pitcher out of the games the team played that season. Additionally, for even better normalization of pitchers, since pitching more often would contribute to more losses, I will use Loss Shares _per inning pitched_ to compared pitchers. As a consequence of that, to weed out pitchers who played a game or two and didn't give up any runs (would have 0 loss shares, but won't measure best because they didn't play very much), I will only look at pitchers who played in at least 20 games."

The best individual season between 1985 and 2016 was Dwight Gooden's 1985 season, who won the NL Cy Young Award (given to the best pitcher in the league that season), was an All-Star, and lead the league that season is wins, ERA, and strikeouts. The second best was by Pedro Martinez (who shows up three times on the list), winning the Cy Young Award for each season he was on the list and is a Hall of Famer. The individuals who show up most on the list are Clayton Kershaw (current 8x All-Star, 3x NL Cy Young Award winner) and Greg Maddux (8x All-Star, 4x NL Cy Young Award, and Hall of Famer).

John Tudor's 1985 season was the 8th best ever between the 31 seasons in the set according to loss shares per inning; however, he was not even an All-Star for that season (and was never an All-Star in his career), although Dwight Gooden deservedly won the Cy Young Award over him according to the ranking. Finally, even though he was an 11x All-Star and 7x Cy Young Award winner, Roger Clemens' best season was in 1990 (12th overall), where he actually did not win the Cy Young Award, losing to Bob Welch, who led the league in the pitchers' win statistic that season (but is not on this list). For seasons earlier in the set, it appears that conventional wisdom valued the pitchers' wins statistics more heavily than ERA (even though ERA is a better indicator of actual wins/losses contributed to by a pitcher), causing the Cy Young Award be given to someone like Bob Welch instead of Roger Clemens. Therefore, even though pitchers like Roger Clemens and Clayton Kershaw were given lots of recognition and awards in their career, their best seasons were not properly awarded, and John Tudor was completely overlooked. While still pretty good at recognizing great pitching, conventional MLB awards failed to recognize some of the best individual pitching seasons historically."

    "In terms of modeling a team's success, regular season statistics were effective in some areas and not effective in others. Regular season statistics were very effective at predicting the amount of games a team won across a season, the most successful of low dimensionality being the one with input variables for runs scored, earned run average, and fielding percentage. While it is not revolutionary to say that more runs scored and fewer runs given up would lead to more wins for a baseball team, what this model does successfully is give an expectation (with about + or - 5 games) of how many games a team should win if they reach certain benchmarks for statistics across the season. If a team wants to win, for example, about 95 games for the season, they could set target goals for runs scored, ERA for the team, and fielding percentage that they would have to hit in order to do so. Furthermore, in team building during the off-season, a general manager could assemble a team of players, who based on past season performances, aggregate out to the input variables for the team, which should give a pretty good estimate for how many games the team will win."

    "On the other hand, regular season statistics don't appear to be a successful indicator of post-season success. Out of the field of divisional winners, the logistic regression model for predicting league winners in the post-season did not even predict one team to win it. Given the marginal differences between playoff teams and the good number of them actually in the playoffs, it appears that regular season success is not a good model for predicting teams that went onto win the league. For teams then, this means that the primary objective of a team is to do good enough just to make the playoffs, as there is enough randomness within a playoff series (only a small sample of games), meaning that regular season success does not necessarily carry over to the post-season. This is also seen in predicting World Series winners out of the set of League winners, as the better team in the regular season only won about 58% of the time."

   "source": [
    "In the analysis of the team payrolls, a team's relative total payroll for a season (z-score) practically had no impact on the model predicting wins, and wasn't very correlated with any of the input variables. What this means is that teams that spent more relative to others teams in a season were not more likely to win games, and were not very correlated with the variables that contributed to winning (runs scored, ERA, and fielding percentages). Because of this, the competitive balance tax appears to be effective at creating parity in the MLB, as teams that spend more payroll are not more likely to win games. This is a good result for the MLB, as there is no revenue sharing across teams, which means that teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers or the Boston Red Sox that are in bigger markets (and thus have a lot more money to spend than teams in smaller markets) appear to not be advantaged in any way in terms of winning games by spending more."

Additionally, based on the later careers of the players on the top 25 most valuable batters list, great success on rookie contracts is very predictive of future success, further enforcing why teams should draft and develop well. Teams can get the most value out of these players on their rookie deals and then try to pay them what they are worth (not as valuable in pure salary terms anymore, but watch them get even better as their careers progress)."

Since these snubs were at both ends of the timeframe of the database, it appears that the MLB has not and still isn't identifying the best pitchers (even historically great ones) with conventional awards, at least as well as batters are."

To keep things constistent in order to analyze the effectiveness of the competitive balance tax and the value of individual players, each set had to be reduced to contain only seasons between those years. This means that historical contexts are left out, such as seeing how well wins can be modeled across all seasons, or even seeing the most impactful or valuable players of all time in baseball."

A decent amount of player salaries were not recorded in the original database, which means that the total payroll of teams were not completely accurate and that not every player could be included in calculating and ranking the most valuable players in the timeframe. Additionally, there could be some errors in the set, especially for salary data, as at least one player (Dion James) was recorded as having a salary of 0 dollars for a season, which is obviously not possible. This ultimately weakens the findings about the effectiveness of the competitive balance tax and for the value of players, as the data is incomplete and important, impactful information could be missing."
